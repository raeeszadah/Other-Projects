Technical Requirement Document (TRD) – Portfolio Web Application 

The application is built using HTML for structure, Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) will be used for smooth, high-performance animations.
The website will be a single-page application (SPA) experience with a smooth, responsive design that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The content will be hardcoded within the HTML and JavaScript files, as there is no backend or Content Management System (CMS).

4. Non-Functional Requirements
•	Performance: The site must be lightweight and fast-loading, with a focus on optimized images and efficient GSAP animations to achieve a high Lighthouse score.
•	Responsiveness: The layout must be fluid and adapt gracefully to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop) using Tailwind's responsive utilities. The animations should also be responsive and scaled appropriately.
•	SEO: Basic SEO will be implemented through proper HTML structure, semantic tags, and meta tags. No server-side rendering is available.
•	Accessibility: Adherence to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, including proper use of alt text for images and ARIA attributes where necessary for interactive elements.
•	User Experience (UX): The website must offer a smooth, intuitive, and visually appealing experience with well-timed and purposeful animations.
